# Weights & Biases AWS Module

**IMPORTANT:** You are viewing a beta version of the official module to install
Weights & Biases. This new version is incompatible with earlier versions, and it
is not currently meant for production use. Please contact your Customer Success
Manager for details before using.

This is a Terraform module for provisioning a Weights & Biases Cluster on AWS.
Weights & Biases Local is our self-hosted distribution of wandb.ai. It offers
enterprises a private instance of the Weights & Biases application, with no
resource limits and with additional enterprise-grade architectural features like
audit logging and SAML single sign-on.

## About This Module

## Pre-requisites

This module is intended to run in an AWS account with minimal preparation,
however it does have the following pre-requisites:

### Credentials / Permissions

**AWS Services Used**

- AWS Key Management System (KMS)
- Amazon Aurora MySQL
- Amazon VPC
- Amazon S3

### Public Hosted Zone

If you are managing DNS via AWS Route53 the hosted zone entry is created
automatically as part of your domain management.

If you're managing DNS outside of Route53, please see the documentation on
[creating a hosted zone for a
subdomain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-routing-traffic-for-subdomains.html),
which you will need to do for the subdomain you are planning to use for your
Terraform Enterprise installation. To create this hosted zone with Terraform,
use [the `aws_route53_zone`
resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route53_zone).

## How to Use This Module

- Ensure account meets module pre-requisites from above.
- Please note that while some resources are individually and uniquely tagged,
  all common tags are expected to be configured within the AWS provider as shown
  in the example code snippet below.

- Create a Terraform configuration that pulls in this module and specifies
  values of the required variables:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "<your AWS region>"
  default_tags {
    tags = var.common_tags
  }
}

module "wandb" {
  source    = "<filepath to cloned module directory>"
  namespace = "<prefix for naming AWS resources>"
}
```

- Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`

## Examples

We have included documentation and reference examples for additional common
installation scenarios for Weights & Biases, as well as examples for supporting
resources that lack official modules
